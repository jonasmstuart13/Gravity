        The three primary features of the keeling curve are the increasing rate
        at which atmospheric CO2 has continued to rise, the fluctuation of
        atmospheric CO2 by season, and the variability of CO2 by season depends
        upon the location of measurement. Seasonal differences in the CO2 result
        from the variability of plant life, climate, land area, and wind
        currents. Firstly, the underlying reason for the fluctuation in Keeling
        Curve is that during summer months the quantity of atmospheric CO2
        recesses in sync with the increasing activity of plant life and winter
        months bring higher output of CO2 into the atmosphere as photosynthesis
        slows and plants decay. CO2 levels are maximized in May and minimized in
        October. From May until October CO2 expulsion by decaying plants is less
        than CO2 consumption by photosynthesizing plants. The opposite of this
        is true in the second portion of the year. Also, the Northern Hemisphere
        contains 68% of earth’s land mass as compared with the Southern
        Hemisphere’s mere 32%. As the Southern Hemisphere is primarily ocean,
        photosynthesis does impact the Southern Hemisphere as it does the
        Northern Hemisphere. This further results in the Northern Hemisphere
        dominating atmospheric CO2 levels. The shortage of land in the Southern
        Hemisphere expands the climate’s role in determining the variability of
        CO2.Temperate climate zones,from 23.5o to 66o, experience increasingly
        distinct seasons as latitude increases. Extremity of seasonal change
        directly correlates with the extremity of CO2 fluctuation. The Northern
        Hemisphere’s temperate zone spans expansive regions, while the Southern
        Hemisphere’s temperate zone spans minute areas. Therefore, seasons and
        their CO2 fluctuations are more distinct in the Northern Hemisphere than
        the Southern Hemisphere. All of the previously mentioned contrasting
        elements of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere could be deemed
        insignificant as CO2 disperses throughout the atmosphere. However,
        atmospheric mixing does not occur immediately or evenly. In relation to
        the mixing of atmospheric gases Rob Monroe said, “It takes roughly a
        year for the air to mix between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.
        The mixing within each hemisphere, in contrast is only weeks to months.”
        This phenomenon along with contrasts in plant life, climate, land area,
        and wind currents serve to explain the data found by the Keeling Curve.
        Measurements of atmospheric CO2 levels were taken at four different
        locations.The extremity seasonal variation in CO2 recorded by each
        station in increasing order is the South Pole, American Samoa, Mauna
        Loa, and Barrow, Alaska. Barrow, located at 71° N, 156° W, and Mauna
        Loa, at 19° N, 155° W, had higher fluctuations as they were in the
        Northern Hemisphere, but Barrow’s readings were still higher as it was
        located near an area of extreme seasons. Located at 14° S, 170° W,
        American Samoa’s measurements were caused by its existence in the
        Southern Hemisphere, but it is in the tropics and also closer to the
        north. Finally, the south pole reads almost no fluctuation as it is in
        the southern hemisphere and has no plant life.
